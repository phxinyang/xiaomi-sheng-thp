# xiaomi-sheng-thp

`xiaomi-sheng-thp` provides userspace multitouch and Xiaomi Focus Pen input
for the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro (`sheng`) with an NT36532E touch controller. It
reads raw THP frames from the kernel and creates standard Linux input devices
through uinput.

Finger input, multi-touch tracking, palm rejection, pen coordinates, tilt,
hover, and Bluetooth HID pressure are supported for both the Xiaomi Focus Pen
and Focus Pen Pro. Ordinary pens are exposed as `NVTCapacitivePenM80p`
(pressure `0..8191`); Focus Pen Pro is exposed as `NVTCapacitivePenP81c`
(pressure `0..16383`, with stock-compatible `ABS_BRAKE`). Focus Pen Pro also
maps pinch/double-press to stylus buttons and slides to
`Xiaomi Focus Pen Gestures` (`KEY_PROG3` / `KEY_PROG4`). Please note that pen
scanning is only available when the panel is running at 60 Hz or 120 Hz.

## Requirements

- A Linux kernel for Xiaomi Sheng exposing:

  ```text
  /proc/nvt_thp_raw
  /proc/nvt_thp_stream
  /proc/nvt_thp_status
  /proc/nvt_thp_stylus
  ```

- `/dev/uinput`
- BlueZ for Xiaomi Focus Pen pressure input
- A C++20 compiler and GNU Make when building from source

[xiaomi-pen-status](https://github.com/ianchb/xiaomi-pen-status) is recommended for pen detection, Bluetooth connection
assistance, and refresh-rate notifications. It is optional and is not required
for the touch service to start.

The service runs as root because it controls the THP stream, reads the pen HID
transport, and creates uinput devices.

## Build

```sh
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

The default build enables Focus Pen Pro haptics and links against libsystemd.
To build without haptics:

```sh
make HAPTICS=0 -j"$(nproc)"
```

The executable is written to `build/xiaomi-sheng-thp`.

## Install

```sh
sudo make install
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now xiaomi-sheng-thp.service
```

## Debian Package

```sh
./build-deb.sh
sudo apt install ./xiaomi-sheng-thp_*_arm64.deb
```
